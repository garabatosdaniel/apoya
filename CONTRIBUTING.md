# Contribute to Apoya

Great thanks for your interest!

There are lots of things to do here!!

## Documentation

We need to have very usable nice documentation, please try to submit it as markdown, we can later convert it to some other thing

## Code

Great!!! We also need lots of code, well thought code that is :), but let me help you set up your environment

Currently the idea of the development cycle is:

1. Run an instance of apoya through vagrant
2. Modify your code
3. Reload code using nRepl

Steps 2 and 3 might be very confusing once you start writing code for real, since you can change one function and test, so you might see them as this other step:

2. Play with your code

If you don't have a clojure editor or IDE, I recommend the following:

* Vim + Fireplace (that's what I use)
* Emacs + Cider (Most clojure folks would use this)
* Eclipse + CounterClockWise (I have tested this and it seems to work great, it has a paredit mode, nRepl and Leiningen integration plus support from @petitlaurent seems to be great)

There's also IntelliJ + LaClojure, but it doesn't support nRepl yet. The developers have already written it, but it is currently in intellij 13, I tested it and it's not so stable.. so please stick to the options above for now :)

Oh just one more request:

Don't use freaking tabs, if you must, please turn them into spaces. :)
